# Anomalies-Outliers-Introduction-to-detection-and-Automation-with-example
In this tutorial I tried to cover what Anomalies in simple terms , why we need to detect them , what are the type of anomalies and some of the methods used .
In this tutorial I explained Why ML algorithms are the most important anmolie detector through cases and visualization ?
Also you will find an introduction to anomaly detection using Pycaret and walk through some examples with visualization
Kindly have a look at the references at the last cell in the notebook .
